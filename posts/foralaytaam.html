<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
	Within my master's degree program, I had the opportunity to do an internship with 4 other
	students. Our goal was to create a brand new website for an organization called
	<em>For Al Aytaam</em>. I had two roles in the team: UI/UX designer and developper. There were two
	other designers but I was the only developper.
</p>

<p class="bold">The team:</p>
<ul>
	<li>UI/UX designer, developper - me</li>
	<li>Web editor, translator</li>
	<li>Web editor, translator</li>
	<li>UI/UX designer, web editor</li>
	<li>UI designer, translator</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I will only elaborate on my mission as a UI/UX designer.</p>

<p>
	<em>For Al Aytaam</em> is a non profit organization which establishes campaigns to raise money for
	orphanages all around the world. They usually go themselves on location to check with the people
	in charge of the orphanage what needs to be done and how much money will be needed.

<h2>Design challenges</h2>
<p>
	As a UI/UX designer, I was in charge of the information architecture, the home page and the
	campaign page.
</p>
<p>
	The organization had an outdated website that wasn't even made by proper professionals. It was
	made by members of the organization on a site builder. The problem with that website is that it
	was never updated, it did not contain all the necessary information for potential donors.
</p>
<p class="strong">It looked unprofessional and did not inspire trust.</p>

<p>
	With the new website, the main goals of the organization were to gather money for their campaigns,
	have a place to centralize all the information about them and their actions as well as show their
	transparency and reliability.
</p>
<p>
	They had a good amount of content and were active on social media so we had something to work on.

<h2>Design solutions</h2>
<h3>The home page</h3>

<p>
	The first idea that came to mind was to create a home page with an interactive map and pins (with
	the form of the logo) to show that the organization is very active. In fact they have helped a lot
	of orphanages in many countries such as Mexico, Jordan, Guinea, Morocco, Thailand etc.
</p>

<p class="subhead">Low-fidelity prototype of the home page</p>

<p>
	As you can see in the example above, there is also a banner containing the statistics of the
	organization, that are supposed to change as new campaigns are funded. I noticed that usually the
	types of help they give are always the same: health kits, school supplies, clothes, food and help
	in building. Displaying this on the home page can really speak for itself, it gives the visitors
	concrete numbers about what <em>For Al Aytaam</em> does.
</p>
<p>Also, we all like to see some data and numbers! My team agreed on this one.</p>

<p class="subhead">Example of interactive map that could be used on home page</p>

<p>
	Soon enough, I realized that seeing an interactive map directly on the home page, without any
	explanation, would not be the best idea for a user, especially a first-time visitor.
</p>
<p>
	But we thought that this map could be reused somewhere else on the website to better convey that
	the organization has helped in a lot of different places. It would also be a simpler way to browse
	through the campaigns.
</p>

<p>Here is a higher fidelity prototype I made:</p>

<p class="subhead">Higher fidelity prototype of the home page</p>

<p>
	The main intention behind this design is to have a home page giving you an overview of what you
	can find on this website and at the same time it invites you to consult the other sections of the
	website.
</p>
<p>The client wanted on their website these different sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a campaign page</li>
	<li>a testimonial page where we can find testimonials of orphans and orphanage workers</li>
	<li>an event page</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course this is in addition to the basic pages: "About us" and "Contact us"</p>

<p>
	The brief description would contain a link redirecting to "About us", the last campaign would
	redirect to the campaign page and the last testimonial would redirect to the testimonial page.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually we decided to drop the event section as they did not plan to do a lot of them and it
	was useless to have an empty section on the website.
</p>

<h3>The campaign page</h3>

<p>
	For this page I decided to go for a card design for each campaign and add some sort of
	gamification with progress bars and once again numbers! This is a simple way to present the
	information and it is easily understadable by the users. Just with a glimpse they can see which
	project are funded and which are currently funding, they can also see which need more money and
	which don't.

<p>
	This design was validated by my team and the client and I was able to make it into a higher
	fidelity prototype:

<h3>The final product</h3>

<p>I added some colours and refined the prototype to make it more alive:</p>

<h3>The mobile version</h3>

<p>I also worked on the prototype of the mobile version, here are some pictures:</p>
