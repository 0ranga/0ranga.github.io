<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
	One of the most fundamental parts of learning a musical instrument is to learn the scales. The
	basic ones are the major and minor scales which are the first ones learned by any musician,
	whether you follow a classical path or even a jazz path.
</p>
<p>
	The challenge is to know which fingers are supposed to go on which key to be able to go up and
	down the keyboard by following the notes of the scale.
</p>

<p class="subhead">How the fingerings work on the piano</p>

<p>
	As a pianist myself, I have always found the process of learning the scales on the piano quite
	unadapted to the instrument. In fact, the piano is a very visual instrument and it can help a lot
	to learn it visually when it makes more sense than with a sheet.
</p>
<p>
	Note that I have nothing against music theory and music notation, if anything I encourage anyone
	that wants to learn a musical instrument to get a good grasp of music theory and notation as it
	enables you to have the tools to understand music thoroughly.
</p>
<p>However, in some cases like this one, there may be tools more useful.</p>
<h2>Design challenges</h2>

<p>
	There are 12 different notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B). For each of these notes
	there is a corresponding major scale and a corresponding minor scale (there are a lot of other
	types of scale but these two are the most used in western music).
</p>
<p>This is what a typical exercise looks like:</p>

<img src="images/piano-scales/pianoscales-exercise.png" alt="" />
<p class="subhead">
	Example of scale exercise from "Scales arpeggios and candences for piano" by Jeff Manookian
</p>

<p>
	On this page we see only two scales, we have 24 of them when we add up the major and the minor
	scales. That would make 12 pages to display the same exercise as in the example above. Of course,
	on this page there are rythmic exercises that may be omitted and we could probably fit more scales
	on a page to use it as a reference tool. The rythmic exercises can be easily created by the
	musician.
</p>
<p>
	One of my goal was to have some kind of reference tool that would be user-friendly and skimmed
	with ease.
</p>
<p>
	Moreover, it is not just about the size of the document, as said before it is also about the way
	we learn the scales. A sheet cannot help that much at visualizing the notes of the scales on the
	keyboard. It cannot really help either at visualizing which scale is related to which or which
	ones are close.
</p>
<p class="strong">
	In the end what I wanted to create was a reference tool that would be ergonomic, compact, useful
	and visual.
</p>

<h2>Design solutions</h2>
<p>
	The final result is a one page document on which we can see all the major and minor scales along a
	circle of fifths so that we can see how they are related to one another.
</p>
<p>
	All the information needed is here: the major scales, their relative minor scales, the circle of
	fifths, the key signatures and the fingerings.

<p>To get there I had to go through several different steps.</p>
<p>
	The circle of fifths is a wonderful tool used by a lot of musicians (not only pianists) to have a
	visual representation of all the scales relationships.
</p>

<img src="images/piano-scales/pianoscales-circle.png" alt="" />

<p>
	The example used above is a very good one as it includes the major scales but also their relative
	minor scales and their key signatures.
</p>
<p class="bold">A little more about that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		each major scale has a relative minor scale containing the same notes but starting on a
		different one
	</li>
	<li>
		the key signatures are at the beginning of a staff, this is what tells you which scale is used
		on a sheet
	</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-style: italic">
	If you want to know more about all of that I invite you to look into music theory.
</p>
<p>I chose to include all these elements in the product, here is the first stage:</p>

<img src="images/piano-scales/pianoscales-stage1.png" alt="" />

<p class="bold">Once this was done, a few ideas came to my mind to make it better:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		make the black keys of the scales darker so that we can differentiate them from the white keys
	</li>
	<li>add the fingerings</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Also, I posted it on
	<a
		href="https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/axzb0h/a_visual_chart_ive_made_to_practice_major_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x"
		>reddit.com/r/piano</a
	>
	to get users' input about it.
</p>
<p class="bold">Along with minor corrections this is what came most from other users:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the fingerings should be added</li>
	<li>
		something like a background should be added to make it more readable as some keyboards are not
		directly aligned with the scale names
	</li>
	<li>
		the outermost rim with the keys should contain the major scales instead of the minor ones to
		make it seamless with the central circles where the outermost rim contains the names of the
		major scales
	</li>
	<li>
		a lowercase "m" should be added next to the minor scale letters as it is how they are commonly
		spelled
	</li>
	<li>
		the key signatures should also contain the treble clef (for the left hand) just like it does in
		any piano sheet
	</li>
	<li>printer-friendly color should be used so that anyone can print it with a home printer</li>
	<li>black keys should be darker</li>
	<li>a black and white version would be appreciated as some users were colorblind</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
	All these suggestions were taken into account to make the final product, as well as other
	suggestions like making versions with minor scales only and major scales only and versions with
	solfege notation.
